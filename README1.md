# VirtualPet
This file was created with the intention of creating a virtual pet.
I created a VirtualPet class from the main Program
First I created the properties for the virtual pet in the VirtualPet class and gave them variable names
I then made it so that you would be able to get and remember the names that the user would input
I created methods for speaking to, feeding, and playing with the pet
In the main program, I called the VirtualPet class in order so that the information that was inputed in the class would be able to be called
The user has the ability to name the pet, give it a color, and give it an age.
They are then able to make it speak, feed it, or play with it.
